**Description**

TMyToken is an ERC-20 token built with Solidity that allows minting, burning, and transferring tokens. It has 3 decimal places and gives the owner control to mint new tokens. Users can burn their tokens or transfer them to others. The initial supply is 100 tokens.

**FEATURES**

Minting: The contract owner can mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.

Burning: Any token holder can burn their own tokens, permanently reducing the total supply.

Custom Decimals: The token uses 3 decimal places instead of the default 18, allowing precise token values.

Token Transfers: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses via the tokenTransfer function.
